Hypothesis:
This project is aimed to determine whether fear and greed index is a leading or lagging indicator.


Data:
2 datasets are provided that include daily values of the price of bitcoin and the value of the feaer and greed index for bitcoin.
Dataset size: 6 years, 2 months, 2 days. 2225 units


main.py:
main.py calculates the changes in daily values and compares the change in bitcoin prices and change in fear and greed.


Conclusion:
If Bitcoin is a leading indicator of Fear & Greed for: 10 days, using 2214 data point, there is a correlation of: 0.5081
If Bitcoin is a leading indicator of Fear & Greed for: 9 days, using 2215 data point, there is a correlation of: 0.5043
